## 📱 Application Overview

### Purpose
VishwaSetu is designed to empower villagers, migrant workers, and students in India. It doesn't just teach vocabulary; it prepares users for **survival and employment** in foreign countries (French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Arabic) using their mother tongue as the bridge.

### Key Features
- **Job-Specific Context**: Asks users about their career path to provide relevant technical terms (e.g., "Voltage" for Engineering, "Password" for IT, "Prescription" for Healthcare).
- **Cultural Etiquette Integration**: Teaches non-verbal cues and social rules (like bowing in East Asia or 'Bonjour' in France) alongside the language.
- **Country-Ready Curriculum**: Focuses on workplace dialogue, navigating transport, asking for medical help, and daily transactions.
- **Voice-First Interaction**: Designed for accessibility; users can learn via continuous conversation.
- **Immediate Greeting**: Proactive engagement starting from the moment the user clicks "Start Learning."

## 🌟 Suggested Future Enhancements

To make VishwaSetu even more powerful for our learners, we suggest the following feature roadmap:

### 1. **Visual Sign Bridge (Vision Integration)**
- **Feature**: Use the phone's camera to "see" work-site signs, safety manuals, or medicine labels.
- **Benefit**: VishwaSetu can read the sign in the foreign language and explain its meaning and safety implications in the user's native Indian language.

### 2. **Emergency "Quick-Help" Mode**
- **Feature**: A dedicated voice command that instantly teaches the user how to say "I need a doctor," "Call the police," or "I am lost" in the target language.
- **Benefit**: Provides immediate security for workers who find themselves in frightening situations abroad.

### 3. **Roleplay Simulations**
- **Feature**: Scenarios like "Asking your Boss for a Leave" or "Negotiating at a local market."
- **Benefit**: Builds confidence by simulating high-pressure interactions in a safe, guided environment.

### 4. **Dialect & Slang Support**
- **Feature**: Option to learn local slang (e.g., Quebecois French vs. Parisian French).
- **Benefit**: Helps workers integrate better into local communities where standard textbook language might not be common.

### 5. **Progress Report Cards**
- **Feature**: A voice-based summary of what the user has learned (e.g., "Today you learned 5 construction tools and how to say hello").
- **Benefit**: Provides a sense of achievement and helps users track their journey to becoming "Country-Ready."
